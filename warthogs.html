                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>Warthogs may appear to be ferocious little animals, and contrary to Pumba the warthog eating worms in the Lion King, they are not carnivores. Warthogs are grazers, eating grasses, plants, berries and bark. They also use their snouts to dig up roots and bulbs.</p>
     <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.</p>
   <p>Warthogs are a part of the Swine family, meaning they are related to pigs, hogs and boars. Like their relatives, these plump, hooved mammals have large nostrils at the end of their snout. Baby warthogs are even called piglets. They tend to have little fur, except for a mane that goes to the middle of their back.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Warthogs next to Wild things coffee shop.</p>
